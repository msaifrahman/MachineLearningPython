Predicting Productivity of Blast Furnace

A Steel manufacturer wants to find out the optimum values for the input parameters which both maximizes his blast furnace and 
also minimizes his carbon footprint. To this end, they have gathered data over a long period of days and tabulated them. 
They have approached us to provide them with an:
•	Appropriate model which can identify these parameters for their further investigation.
•	Using the data we need to build a model which can predict Productivity
